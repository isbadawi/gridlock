    <p>Your goal is to get the red block to the right side of the grid.
       You may click and drag blocks to move them, but horizontal blocks can only go left or right,
       and vertical blocks can only go up or down. Good luck!</p>

      Sorry, your browser doesn't support the canvas element.
